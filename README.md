# Cluster-UAV-Fusion-Dataset

This is a dense reconstructed dataset of multiple UAVs in a large scale scene, which include *Factory*, *Famensi*, *GuanshanPark*, *Huanpu*, *Wutai*, *Yuhuazhai*. 

The dataset comprises high-resolution image data obtained by multiple UAVs, along with corresponding GNSS data. Each image contains over 12,000,000 pixels and covers various scenes, including urban and farmland areas. The dataset is suitable for applications such as map production, collaborative mapping using multiple UAVs, and machine learning algorithm training.

The images in this dataset are sequential images and contain GPS information. What'more, we give the reconstruction results of the dataset, which can be use as benchmarks. The Dataset can be get [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NMOMssG6Dvnhb1ghf3d9dA
